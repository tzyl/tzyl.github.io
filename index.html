            <p>Hi!</p>
            <p>I'm Tim, a third year MMath Mathematics student at Balliol College, University of Oxford.</p>
            <p>As well as mathematics, I'm passionate about programming and problem solving. I love challenging myself and learning new skills.</p>
            <p>I also greatly enjoy teaching and mathematics outreach work: to further people's understanding of what the subject is really about and to make them more interested in learning it. My interests also include consulting, partly due to my love of problem solving and strong analytical skillset.</p>
